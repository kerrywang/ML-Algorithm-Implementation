# Bayesian Model

### Bayes Theorem / Bayes Rule

`P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)`
Use knowledge or belief that we already have to help us calculate the probability of a related event
### Bayesian Inference
Bayesian Inference is when we use Bayes Rule to obtain the conditional probability of some parameter given the data, P(Y|X) above.
